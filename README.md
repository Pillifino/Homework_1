# Homework_1
The goal of this project was to successfully refactor a marketing agency's (SEO) code in order to comply with accessiblity standards and optimized for search engines.
After creating my own repository and copying the websites code, I made multiple adjustments to the code's semantic stucture and elements. Along the way I encounterd
multiple issues with the images which were corrected by adding those images into the directory I created for the assignment and make sure to create a relative file path to each image. 
Acessibility was added by creating semantic tags and adding alt tags to each image for those who may be visually impaired. You can track this project through the commits!
