**Project Task**
Refactor marketing agency's website in order to compy with accessibility standars and optimize for search engines.

**Main Changes**
  
  **Semantics**
  - Replaced <div> tags with Semantic elements such as header,nav,footer,aside,etc
  - organized html and css code to better follow semantic structure
      Example of structure
        <header> 
        <main> 
        <article> 
        <section> 
        <aside> 
        <footer> 
      
  **Accessiblity**
  - consolidated code by grouping classes together in html and css files for both the <main> and <aside> sections
  - Added Alt tags for all images
  - Added media responsiveness for screens under 768 px (This still needs a little work but it's a start)
